Using a Proper Project Setup
Depending on the version of the Flutter SDK you're using, the project you're working on might not have all files you need to follow along in this module.

Make sure you create a project with the following command to get all those files:

flutter create -i objc -a java myapp
Otherwise, you might be missing crucial iOS and/ or Android files we'll write code in, in this module.
